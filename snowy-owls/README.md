## Tools, citations, and methodology used in this project:

* The [Linux Mint 20.2](https://linuxmint.com/) version of [QGIS 3.22.1-Białowieża](https://www.qgis.org) was used to create static maps.
* A customized Scalable Vector Graphic (SVG) of a Snowy Owl icon [<img src="images/SnowyOwlHead_AdobeStock_245954980_Modified.svg" width="18 px"/>](images/SnowyOwlHead_AdobeStock_245954980_Modified.svg) was created by modifying Adobe Stock graphic #245954980 in [Inkscape 1.1.1](https://inkscape.org/) for use within QGIS and Mapbox.
* [ArcGIS Pro 2.9](https://www.esri.com/en-us/arcgis/products/arcgis-pro/overview) on a Windows 10 [Virtual Machine](https://www.virtualbox.org/) was used to create the Snowy Owl distribution heat map.
* [VSCodium 1.63.1](https://github.com/VSCodium/vscodium) was used for coding/editing.
* [GitKraken 8.2.0](https://www.gitkraken.com/) used to interact with GitHub.
* Data is shown on [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/) web map with geolocation services enabled.
* Snowy Owl location and migration path data comes from [Movebank.org](https://www.movebank.org/cms/webapp?gwt_fragment=page=studies,path=study12112706) in coordination with the Max Planck Institute of Animal Behavior (Germany), the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences (USA), and the University of Konstanz (Germany).
* Snowy Owl range spatial data (tabular or geopackage) is made available at [eBird.org](https://ebird.org/science/status-and-trends/download-data).
1:50m Gray Earth basemap, geographical name locations, rivers and lakes are from [NaturalEarthData.com](https://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/).
* Sea Ice Extent shapefiles are from the [National Snow & Ice Data Center](https://nsidc.org/data/seaice_index/archives).
* Terrestrial Ecoregions GIS Data from [GIS Lounge](https://www.gislounge.com/terrestrial-ecoregions-gis-data/).
* The projected coordinate reference systems used in the static maps is the WGS 84 Canada Atlas Labert Conformal Conic (ESRI: 102215) and WGS 84 Canada Polar Stereographic (EPSG: 5937).
* Stock photos with open licensing were used as much as possible and are for illustrative and educational purposes with attribution and links to the original sources as applicable.
