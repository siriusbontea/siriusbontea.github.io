## *Who am I?*
### Sirius is an artist, scientist, bibliophile, and autodidact at heart, and enjoys applying these facets in his role of dad and husband first and foremost. He also finds happiness with spending time with Shin'yū the Maltipoo (Shin'yū or 親友 is the Japanese term for "best friend"). Sirius also enjoys calligraphy, metacognition, philosophy, and the pursuit of arcane knowledge regardless of the path it puts him on. He generally prefers Open Source Software solutions such as FreeBSD for daily computing, QGIS for cartography and geospatial analysis, GIMP and Inkscape for image manipulation. However, he is no stranger to proprietary solutions such as ArcGIS Pro, Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator.
