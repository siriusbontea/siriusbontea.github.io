### This is where I'll eventually put some stuff.

For now, check out a few small projects I've been working on:

- [Mapping Kentucky's Owls](https://siriusbontea.github.io/kentucky-owls)
- [North American Snowy Owls](https://siriusbontea.github.io/snowy-owls)
- [Electrical Power in the United States](https://siriusbontea.github.io/electrical-power)
