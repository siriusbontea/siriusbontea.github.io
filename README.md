>The decline of geography in academia is easy to understand: we live in an age of ever-increasing specialization, and geography is a generalist's discipline. Imagine the poor geographer trying to explain to someone at a campus cocktail party (or even to an unsympathetic administrator) exactly what it is he or she studies.<br>
>*"Geography is Greek for 'writing about the earth.' We study the Earth."*<br>
>*"Right, like geologists."*<br>
>*"Well, yes, but we're interested in the whole world, not just the rocky bits. Geographers also study oceans, lakes, the water cycle..."*<br>
>*"So, it's like oceanography or hydrology."*<br>
>*"And the atmosphere."*<br>
>*"Meteorology, climatology..."*<br>
>*"It's broader than just physical geography. We're also interested in how humans relate to their planet."*<br>
>*"How is that different from ecology or environmental science?"*<br>
>*"Well, it encompasses them. Aspects of them. But we also study the social and economic and cultural and geopolitical sides of--"*<br>
>*"Sociology, economics, cultural studies, poli sci."*<br>
>*"Some geographers specialize in different world regions."*<br>
>*"Ah, right, we have Asian and African and Latin American studies programs here. But I didn't know they were part of the geography department."*<br>
>*"They're not."*<br>
>*(Long pause.)*<br>
>*"So, uh, what is it that do study then?"*<br>
