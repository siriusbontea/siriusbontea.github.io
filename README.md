## *Who is this guy?*
### Sirius is an artist, scientist, bibliophile, and autodidact at heart, and enjoys sharing these traits in his role as dad and husband first and foremost. He also finds happiness with spending time with Shin'yū the Maltipoo (Shin'yū or 親友 is the Japanese term for "best friend"). Sirius also enjoys calligraphy, metacognition, philosophy, and the pursuit of arcane knowledge regardless of the path it takes him on. He generally prefers Open Source Software solutions such as Linux for daily computing, QGIS for cartography and geospatial analysis, and GIMP for image manipulation. However, he is no stranger to proprietary solutions such as ArcGIS and Adobe Photoshop.
